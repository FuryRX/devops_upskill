Create a k3d cluster which is a lightweight kubernetes cluster inside docker 
- k3d cluster create rootCluster

The above command creates a cluster using docker containers and each container represents a node in the cluster
3 Nodes gets created tools, root cluster server 1 and 2

Now we will create a worker node and add it to our existing cluster rootCluster 
- k3d create cluster rootCluster - p 9080:80@loadbalancer
This creates a new cluster called rootCluster and maps it on the localhost port 9080
To the load balancer port 80
Allows you to access apps on port 9080 local machine

- k3d node create rootWorker1 -c rootCluster
Add a worker node to the rootCluster

- kubectl cluster-info
To check out cluster info
