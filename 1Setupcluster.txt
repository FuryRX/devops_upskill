Create a k3d cluster which is a lightweight kubernetes cluster inside docker 
- k3d cluster create rootCluster

The above command creates a cluster using docker containers and each container represents a node in the cluster
3 Nodes gets created tools, root cluster server 1 and 2

Now we will create a worker node and add it to our existing cluster rootCluster 
- k3d node create rootWorker1 -c rootCluster
