Create a k3d cluster which is a lightweight kubernetes cluster inside docker 
- k3d cluster create rootCluster

The above command creates a cluster using docker containers and each container represents a node in the cluster
3 Nodes gets created tools, root cluster server 1 and 2

Now we will create a worker node and add it to our existing cluster rootCluster 
- k3d create cluster rootCluster - p 9080:80@loadbalancer
This creates a new cluster called rootCluster and maps it on the localhost port 9080
To the load balancer port 80
Allows you to access apps on port 9080 local machine

Another command to create a cluster is
- k3d create cluster devtron -port 8080:30080@agent:0 --agents 1
Means port 8080 local maps to 30080 on cluster on first agent and 1 agent gets brought up

- k3d node create rootWorker1 -c rootCluster
Add a worker node to the rootCluster

- kubectl cluster-info
To check out cluster info

info this command uses the current context to see which cluster to interact with
no need to run
- kubectl config use-context k3d-devtron-local-dev
