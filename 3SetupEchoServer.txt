Inside echoserver folder theres a echoserver deployment
This creates 3 replicas of echoserver containers on container port 8080

- kubectl apply -f ./echoserverdeployment.yaml

Now lets create a service to expose the app
Inside echoserver folder theres a service yaml
This will create a service, selector will choose the label that the service
uses to select which pod to target
Ports:
 port: 80 specifies the service should listen on port 80
 targetPort: 8080 specifies the port the target pods should forward to
 protocol: TCP Which protocol used for the port

- kubectl apply -f ./echoservice.yaml 

Lets now expose the app externally. Atm with service its only accessible within the cluster
We create a ingress controller with ssl redirect on false
and routes incoming requests with the parth / root to backend service named echoserver on port 80
ingress > svc port 80

- kubectl apply -f ./echoserveringress.yaml

curl http://localhost:9080
This will show you what echoserver does, just shows you browser info
Why 9080 because when we created our cluster we specified this
Depending on what port you chose when creating the cluster to map it on your local host
